            <p id="history-p-1">Chainmail dates back to the Iron and Middle Ages in Europe. I will be focusing on its history in Europe as that is the style of chainmail I will be talking about. Chainmail was used well before plate armour was developed and started to fade out of the spotlight as time went on, and as infrastructure grow plate armour was able to be made much quicker and, in some cases, cheaper than chainmail.</p>
            <p id="history-p-2">Chainmail was expensive and took far too much time to make but could save a life on the battle, and those who did die with chainmail soon had it looted by others. As infrastructure improve, soon chainmail found its way to more and more soldiers, until it was later out shine by plate armour which offered more protection and kept a decent amount of mobility that mail offered.</p>
            <p id="fun-facts-paragraph-history">The oldest intact piece of chainmail is from the 1300s.
                Plate armour use to be a supplement to chainmail, until it switched making chainmail the supplement for plate.
                Chainmail could be found as far as the late 19th century.
